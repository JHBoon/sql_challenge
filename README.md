Berkeley bootcamp data analyst week 9 challenge: SQL.

I've used https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/Uq4Pon to create the Entity Relationship Diagram.
Used both the Xpert assistent from the bootcamp dashboard as well as chatGTP to double check, explain or suggest code.
Whenever I used the solutions created by AI, I have manaully typed it into the assignement myself to make sure I understood every single character and command. No copy & pasting.
Additionally I've used the presentation slides from the classes and solved files for reference.
