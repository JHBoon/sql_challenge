Berkeley bootcamp data analyst week 9 challenge: SQL.

I've used https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/Uq4Pon to create the Entity Relationship Diagram.

I used the Xpert assistant from the boot camp dashboard and chatGTP to double-check, explain, or suggest code.
Whenever I used the solutions created by AI, I manually typed them into the assignment myself to ensure I understood every single character and commandâ€”no blind copy & pasting.
Additionally, I've used the presentation slides from the classes and solved files for reference.
